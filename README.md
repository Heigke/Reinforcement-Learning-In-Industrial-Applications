# Reinforcement-Learning-In-Industrial-Applications
In this repository we find the algorithms Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG) applied to the Tennessee Eastman challenge process (http://users.abo.fi/khaggblo/RS/Downs.pdf).
The PPO algorithm is implemented by Nikolay Goodger and can be found in his repository (https://gitlab.com/ngoodger/ppo_lstm/-/blob/master/recurrent_ppo.ipynb) and an astounding description of his work is given in the article Proximal Policy Optimisation with PyTorch using Recurrent models at Medium. The implementation of the Tennessee Eastman challenge process was done by Niklas Kotarsky and Johan Gr√∂nqvist.


# Setup for PPO
To setup just make sure that python 3.8.2 or above is installed with the needed libraries (run the import statements in the notebook and see).
In case they are not installed just install them with pip and retry.

There are several hyperparameters to set for training which can be found under the section hyperparameters in the notebook. We suggest you just run the script as it is to start investigating by yourself.
